# JavaScript Exercise #2

This is an exercise working with an array of objects. We're writing functions to extract important information from an array of coin objects. There are four functions to be written, all of which have been started in the file index.js.

## Installation:
Fork and clone this repository and run the command "npm install" to install all dependencies.

## Exercise:
Read the comments for each function in the file functions.js and write the code required to make each function return the appropriate value without modifying the original array.

## Running the tests
Enter "npm test" in the console to run the tests. When all tests pass, the exercise is complete.

## My solution
If you'd like to see the solution I wrote, it's stored in the repository under the branch "solution".
